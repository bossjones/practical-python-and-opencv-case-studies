#   scaleFactor: How much the image size is reduced at
# each image scale. This value is used to create the scale
# pyramid in order to detect faces at multiple scales
# in the image (some faces may be closer to the foreground,
# and thus be larger; other faces may be smaller
# and in the background, thus the usage of varying
# scales). A value of 1.05 indicates that Jeremy is reducing
# the size of the image by 5% at each level in the
# pyramid.
#   minNeighbors: How many neighbors each window
# should have for the area in the window to be considered
# a face. The cascade classifier will detect multiple

# windows around a face. This parameter controls how
# many rectangles (neighbors) need to be detected for
# the window to be labeled a face.
#   minSize: A tuple of width and height (in pixels) indicating
# the minimum size of the window. Bounding
# boxes smaller than this size are ignored. It is a good
# idea to start with (30, 30) and fine-tune from there.
