# SoundFile is an audio library based on libsndfile, CFFI and NumPy. Full documentation is available on http://pysoundfile.readthedocs.org/.
# SoundFile can read and write sound files. File reading/writing is supported through libsndfile, which is a free, cross-platform, open-source (LGPL) library for reading and writing many different sampled sound file formats that runs on many platforms including Windows, OS X, and Unix. It is accessed through CFFI, which is a foreign function interface for Python calling C code. CFFI is supported for CPython 2.6+, 3.x and PyPy 2.0+. SoundFile represents audio data as NumPy arrays.
# SoundFile is BSD licensed (BSD 3-Clause License).

# Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images.

# Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others. Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.

# Caer is a lightweight, high-performance Vision library for high-performance AI research. We wrote this framework to simplify your approach towards Computer Vision by abstracting away unnecessary boilerplate code giving you the flexibility to quickly prototype deep learning models and research ideas. The end result is a library quite different in its design, that's easy to understand, plays well with others, and is a lot of fun to use.
